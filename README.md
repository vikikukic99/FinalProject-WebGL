# Slider-ShaderMaterial

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/vikikukic99/Slider-ShaderMaterial)

- Falling Letters - they are falling randomly, bugt when you scroll they are falling faster
- Slider - as we did on the class, which i am going to use for capstone
- Background - i tried to pu some background, but its working just when you resize the window.. - from picture i made 3d rotation, with "stars around, which are small planes"
- For the capstone bisade the slider i would like to make when you click on the picture in slider, to rotate 360 and then to open that meal in the menu..
